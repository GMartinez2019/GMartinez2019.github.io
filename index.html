                <h2>Shoes!</h2>
                <p>One of my favorite hobbies involves shoe shopping. I am always looking for a new pair of shoes whether or not I need them.
                If I like a pair I see and the price is great, I don't hesitate to buy them. DSW is where I buy most of my shoes because they just have so many different styles and types of shoes.
                My top two favorite styles are athletic sneakers and boots but I will buy any type of shoe if I like it.

                 <h2>Trying New Places to Eat</h2>       
                <p>I love to try different foods and different places to eat. My Favorite foods are Mexican and Mediterranean but I like just about anything to be honest. I am always open to trying something new.
                Some of my favorite places to eat are Abuelo's Mexican Restaurant and Afrah's Meditterranean. Lately I have been going to new ice cream places as well like Creamistry and Somi Somi
                and the icecream at both places is amazing.</p>

            <h2>Decorating</h2>        
            <p>I love decorating for the holidays! My favorite holiday is Christmas. I love indoor and outdoor decorating. I love decorating the fireplace, putting up the Christmas tree, adding a nativity scene,
                hanging up Christmas lights around the house. This year, I will be adding lighted reindeer and an outdoor lighted spiral Christmas tree as well. I love decorating so much that each year I always have to buy a new piece of holiday decor to add.

            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <P>Travelling is a hobby that I love to do but unfornately have not had the opportunity to do as much exploring as I would like to. The most notable vacation trips I have experienced are our annual trips to Florida.
               Each year my family and I go on a week long trip to some part of Florida. Last year was Destin, this summer I went to Clearwater Beach. While I like visiting Florida each year, I think I am ready to venture to other
               places like Hawaii or Colorado. I also would like to not just travel within the states but to also explore other parts of the world. 
               The top 3 countries I would like to visit oneday are: Italy, Germany, and Japan.
